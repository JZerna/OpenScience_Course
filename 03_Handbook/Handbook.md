# Introduction

The structure of this workshop is loosely based on [Seven easy steps to Open Science: An annotated reading list](https://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000387) by Crüwell et al. (2019).

It is a very good overview of the different aspects that we will cover, and you will find the papers they refer to in the subsections of this course.

You are free to read the Crüwell paper as an introduction or dive right into the subsections. You can even save it for last, as a course summary if you will.

The subsections [Open Science](#open-science), [Open Access](#open-access), [Open Data, Materials, and Code](#open-data-materials-and-code), [Reproducible Analysis](#reproducible-analysis), and [Preregistration](#preregistration) are compulsory course elements, while [Replication Research](#replication-research) is an optional subsection for you to look into if you are interested. We deliberately left out the seventh step, Teaching, in order to make space for the other issues that are more relevant to you right know.

# Open Science

Open Science

A good introduction to Open Science gives the paper by Munafó et al. (2017): [A manifesto for open and reproducible science](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021).

The illustration below (taken from the paper by Munafó et al.) illustrates the concept of Open Science well. It shows the deductive scientifc process and - in red - the threats to the quality of this process. Open Science aims to eliminate these threats, thereby ensuring scientific quality. The cyclic character of the illustration already gives you an idea of one of the most challenging aspects of Open Science: It won't be enough to tackle single threats one by one, you need to address them all. Luckily, many Open Science practises such as preregistration address multiple threats at the same time. And yet, preregistration is one of the practises that is quite easy to implement because it is all in your hands and no one can stop you. Practises that address publication bias are harder to implement because we are still very dependent on publishers for getting our peer-reviewed papers out in the world.

You will get to know the most important Open Science practises throughout this course, so you can get a more in-depth understanding of the motivation behind each practise, tips and resources for how to implement them, and future challenges that have yet to be solved.

Further resources that you can refer to as needed:

- The Open Science Initiative of the faculty of psychology (OSIP) offers monthly meetings, information, and discussion. Sign up [here](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/psychologie/die-fakultaet/open-science?set_language=en).
- Simine Vizire wrote an article in 2018 about the implications of the credibility revolution. It is a good introduction to Open Science, as she paints the bigger picture of how those seemingly disadvantageous practices benefit science in the long run. Read it [here](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691617751884).
- Mallory Kidwell and colleagues wrote a paper in 2016 about how much the badge system of Psychological Science has been contributing to the prevalence and quality of open data. Read it [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456).
- Slides and audio recordings for an introduction workshop on open science by Xenia Schmalz can be found [here](https://osf.io/7sxkg) (why do we need open science, registered reports and preregistration, open research workflow with the open science framework, accessing papers, FAIR data, open science in action).
